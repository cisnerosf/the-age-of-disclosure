# Europe’s deadly hypocrisy

It’s absolutely laughable how Europeans are clutching their pearls over Donald Trump’s comments about the Nato allies. 

Let's be real: we treat our soldiers no better than discarded trash. The hypocrisy is astounding—acting indignant while completely ignoring our own failures to support those who serve. 

Instead of whining about others, perhaps we should take a long, hard look in the mirror. 

But then again, self-reflection isn't exactly our strong suit, is it?
